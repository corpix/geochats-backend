go-boilerplate
--------------
This is a golang headless project boilerplate.

# Install
Make sure your [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) is ok.

You could install boilerplate as usual golang module:
```shell
go get -u github.com/corpix/go-boilerplate/...
```

But this is not so useful, **more often you want the project based on this boilerplate**.

Create a package:

``` shellsession
cd "${GOPATH}/src"
mkdir -p github.com/$USER/my-awesome-project
cd github.com/$USER/my-awesome-project
```

On Linux/OS X:

``` shell
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corpix/go-boilerplate/0247ae4d8164260aa6e6ed02bef17c4d39cc2c67/init.sh | bash
```

You are done!
